# Accessibility Analysis Tool for Web Forms

## Overview

This project provides an Accessibility Analysis Tool for web forms in web applications. It fetches HTML content from a given URL, analyzes the forms present in the content, and provides suggestions to improve accessibility.

## Features

- Fetch HTML content from URLs.
- Analyze forms for accessibility issues.
- Provide suggestions for improving form accessibility.
- Asynchronous fetching for better performance.
- Caching to reduce repeated fetches and improve efficiency.
- Error handling with retries for robustness.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- httpx
- BeautifulSoup4
- lxml
- cachetools

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Prideland-Okoi/fastapi_accessibility-analysis-tool.git
    cd accessibility-analysis-tool
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `. venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the FastAPI application:

    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

2. Use a tool like `curl` or Postman to send a POST request to `/check` with the URL of the webpage you want to analyze:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/check" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "url=http://example.com"
    ```

3. The response will contain a report on the form accessibility issues found on the page.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The entry point of the FastAPI application.
- `models.py`: Defines the Pydantic models used in the application.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for fetching HTML content and analyzing forms.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies for the project.

## Example Response

```json
{
  "report": [
    {
      "field": "<input type=\"text\" id=\"name\">",
      "hasLabel": false,
      "suggestions": [
        "Add a label element associated with this field or an aria-label attribute.",
        "Do not use placeholder as a substitute for labels.",
        "Ensure the required field is clearly indicated."
      ],
      "context": "Your Name"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Optimization and Scalability

- **Asynchronous Requests**: The application uses asynchronous HTTP requests to fetch HTML content, reducing the overall time spent waiting for responses.
- **Caching**: Implements caching to store previously fetched HTML content, reducing the need for repeated fetches.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Includes a retry mechanism for failed HTTP requests to handle transient errors gracefully.
- **Load Balancing and Horizontal Scaling**: For large-scale deployments, consider using load balancers and horizontal scaling.
